# Internship-The-Sparks-Foundation-Data Science &amp; Business Analytics Internship
## Task-1 
### Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm
#### Data Description
The data set contain two variables one is Study Hour and Other is Score obtain in a exam.
#### Objective
Here our task objective is to predict a student Score given his/her hour of study. 
#### Method
After Basic Descriptive analysis of data we apply Linear regression model 
#### Conclusion
We have succesfully develop a linear model for prediction of the score based on a student hour of study.
## Task-2
### Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning Models
#### Data Description
Iris data is a very common dataset in the field .It has banlanced classes data and also there is no missing value.There are five variables in the data set Four are numerical and last one is categorical variable.The Variables are Sepal length ,Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width and Species.
#### Objective
Here we have to find optimum number of cluster and represntation of the cluster in a graphical format
#### Method
After Understanding the variable bhaviours by EDA .we will apply K-means to find the optimumnumber of Cluster.
#### Conclusion
The optimum Cluster will be 3 beacuse it explaning 78 % data correctly with a decent amount of model fitting time
